MetaMerge
=========

This module augments SAML20-SP matadata that have been fetched by MetaRefresh. Elements are added either based on entityId or on entity category (http://macedir.org/entity-category). If specified by entity category fields in the metadata dominate otherwise the template fields overwrite fields in the imported metadata.

Superfluous metadata elements can be stripped to save space.

Merged metadata are written to metadata-generated/saml20-sp-merged.php. After a plausibility check they are moved to the destination specified in the configuration.

Configuration files are located in the metamerge/config directory.

config.php specifies the metadata source, its fingerprint and the path of the merged data relative to the metadata directory.

saml20-sp-mixin.php specifies the transformation process:

$fieldsToStrip is an array of element names to remove.
$defaultTemplate is used for entities that have no match in the template array.
$template is an array of templates indexed by entityId or category.

Hint: Category templates should specify the permissible attributes with a core:AttributeLimit filter to avoid unwanted attribute releases.

Usage: Enable the MetaRefresh module and call metamerge/bin/fetchFederationMetadata.php in a cron job.
